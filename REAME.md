This code appears to be JavaScript code for a web page that allows users to search for weather information for a specific city and display the current weather and a 5-day weather forecast. Let's break it down line by line:

1. `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {`: This line adds an event listener to the `DOMContentLoaded` event of the HTML document. This means that the code inside the listener will be executed when the document's content has finished loading.

2. `const apiKey = 'b374050776d5cda6d0c789791abb3cd2';`: This line defines a constant variable `apiKey` that holds an API key for the OpenWeatherMap API. This key is used to make requests to the API to fetch weather data.

3. `const cityInput = document.getElementById('cityInput');`: This line gets a reference to an HTML input element with the `id` attribute set to `'cityInput'` and stores it in the `cityInput` variable.

4. `const searchButton = document.getElementById('searchButton');`: This line gets a reference to an HTML button element with the `id` attribute set to `'searchButton'` and stores it in the `searchButton` variable.

5. `const weatherIcon = document.getElementById('weatherIcon');`: This line gets a reference to an HTML element with the `id` attribute set to `'weatherIcon'` and stores it in the `weatherIcon` variable. This element is likely used to display weather icons.

6. `const description = document.getElementById('description');`: This line gets a reference to an HTML element with the `id` attribute set to `'description'` and stores it in the `description` variable. This element is likely used to display weather descriptions.

7. `const temperature = document.getElementById('temperature');`: This line gets a reference to an HTML element with the `id` attribute set to `'temperature'` and stores it in the `temperature` variable. This element is likely used to display temperature information.

8. `const humidity = document.getElementById('humidity');`: This line gets a reference to an HTML element with the `id` attribute set to `'humidity'` and stores it in the `humidity` variable. This element is likely used to display humidity information.

9. `const windSpeed = document.getElementById('windSpeed');`: This line gets a reference to an HTML element with the `id` attribute set to `'windSpeed'` and stores it in the `windSpeed` variable. This element is likely used to display wind speed information.

10. `const forecastList = document.getElementById('forecastList');`: This line gets a reference to an HTML element with the `id` attribute set to `'forecastList'` and stores it in the `forecastList` variable. This element is likely used to display the 5-day weather forecast.

11. `searchButton.addEventListener('click', () => {`: This line adds a click event listener to the `searchButton` element. When the button is clicked, the code inside the listener will execute.

12. `const city = cityInput.value;`: This line gets the value entered in the `cityInput` input field and stores it in the `city` variable.

13. `if (city) {`: This line checks if the `city` variable is not empty (i.e., the user entered a city name).

14. `getWeatherData(city);`: If a city name is entered, this line calls the `getWeatherData` function and passes the `city` as an argument. This function is responsible for fetching and displaying current weather data.

15. `async function getWeatherData(city) {`: This line defines an asynchronous function named `getWeatherData` that takes `city` as a parameter. This function will fetch and display the current weather data for the specified city.

16. Inside the `getWeatherData` function, there is a `try` block that starts error handling.

17. `const response = await fetch(`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&units=metric&appid=${apiKey}`);`: This line uses the `fetch` API to send a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the specified `city`, `units`, and `apiKey`. It awaits the response from the API.

18. `const data = await response.json();`: This line reads the JSON data from the API response and stores it in the `data` variable.

19. `const { main, weather, wind } = data;`: This line extracts the `main`, `weather`, and `wind` properties from the `data` object using destructuring.

20. `const [weatherData] = weather;`: This line extracts the first element from the `weather` array and stores it in the `weatherData` variable.

21. The subsequent lines update the HTML elements with the retrieved weather data, such as the weather icon, description, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

22. `getForecastData(city);`: This line calls the `getForecastData` function to fetch and display the 5-day weather forecast for the specified city.

23. The `catch` block (starting at `} catch (error) {`) handles errors that may occur during the API request and data processing and logs an error message to the console.

24. `async function getForecastData(city) {`: This line defines an asynchronous function named `getForecastData` that takes `city` as a parameter. This function is responsible for fetching and displaying the 5-day weather forecast.

25. Inside the `getForecastData` function, there is a `try` block similar to the one in `getWeatherData`.

26. `forecastList.innerHTML = '';`: This line clears the contents of the `forecastList` element.

27. The following lines iterate through the first 5 items in the `list` array (the 5-day forecast data) and create HTML elements to display the date, time, weather description, and temperature for each forecast item. These elements are then appended to the `forecastList` element.

28. The `catch` block for the `getForecastData` function handles errors and logs error messages to the console.

In summary, this code sets up a web page with a search input field and button to fetch and display current weather data and a 5-day weather forecast for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The code uses event listeners, asynchronous functions, and DOM manipulation to achieve this functionality.
